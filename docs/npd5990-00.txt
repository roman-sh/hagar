Information on Applications
This section introduces the application products available for your scanner. The latest application can be installed
at the Epson Web site.

Document Capture Pro / Document Capture
Document Capture Pro is an application that allows you to easily digitize originals such as documents and forms.
You can save scanned images to a specified folder, send by email, and perform copying functions by linking to a
printer. This allows you to streamline the way electronic documents are handled, such as reading large documents
and making best use of network capabilities.
Document Capture Pro is for Windows only. For Mac OS, use Document Capture.
See the Document Capture Pro help (Windows) or Document Capture help (Mac OS) for details on using the
application.
Note:
Document Capture Pro does not support Windows Vista, Windows XP, and Windows Server. Use Epson Scan 2 instead.

Job:
When performed in order, the following operations are known as a job: 1. Scan > 2. Save > 3. Send.
By registering a series of operations in advance as a job, you can perform all of the operations by simply selecting
the job. By assigning a job to the scanner’s control panel, you can start a job from the control panel (Button
Assignment).

Epson Scan 2
Epson Scan 2 is a driver for controlling your scanner, enabling a variety of scan settings. This also allows you to
start either as a standalone application or by using TWAIN-compliant application software.

Battery Charging Precautions
❏ At the time of purchase you need to connect it to the computer with the USB cable. The battery is not fully
charged. Make sure you charge the battery before you run the scanner using the battery.
❏ The battery slowly runs down even when you do not use the scanner. Charge the battery before you run the
scanner using the battery.
❏ If you do not use the scanner for a long time, charge the battery once every six months on a regular basis to
avoid letting it run out.
❏ We recommend turning off the scanner when not in use to save the battery. You can also set the scanner to turn
off automatically after a specified period of time.
❏ The battery’s usable time is shorter in low temperature environments, even if you have charged the battery fully.
❏ You do not need to wait for the battery to run out before charging it.
❏ The battery may be hot right after it is charged or used; this is normal.
❏ The battery cannot be charged or the battery may deteriorate if you charge it in low or high temperatures.
Charge the battery within the guaranteed charging temperature range (8 to 35 °C (46 to 95 °F)).
❏ If the battery runs out quickly even if you are charging the battery within the guaranteed charging temperature
range (8 to 35 °C (46 to 95 °F)) or even after it has been fully charged, the battery may be at the end of its service
life. Contact Epson support to replace the battery.

Charging the Battery
You can charge the battery from a computer with a USB connection.

❏ To avoid causing any damage, do not add excessive force when connecting the USB cable to the USB port.
❏ Connect the scanner directly to the computer without using a USB hub.
❏ Time until full battery charge when the scanner is off.
USB 2.0 port: Approx. 3.5 hours*
* It takes much longer to charge the battery if the scanner is on.

❏ If the battery is fully charged and you do not want to consume the computer’s battery, disconnect the USB cable.
❏ Battery rated capacity: 1140 mAh (3.6 V)
❏ The battery light flashes when the battery is charging. When charging is complete, the light indicates full

device to the same wireless router as the scanner.
Disable the tethering function on the smart device if it is enabled.

❏ You may not be able to connect to the wireless router when the wireless router has multiple SSIDs and devices
are connected to different SSIDs on the same wireless router. Connect the computer or smart device to the same

Solving Problems

❏ A wireless router that is compliant with both IEEE802.11a and IEEE802.11g has SSIDs of 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz. If
you connect the computer or smart device to a 5 GHz SSID, you cannot connect to the scanner because the
scanner only supports communication over 2.4 GHz. Connect the computer or smart device to the same SSID
as the scanner.

❏ Most wireless routers have a privacy separator feature that blocks communication between connected devices. If
you cannot communicate between the scanner and the computer or smart device even if they are connected to
the same network, disable the privacy separator on the wireless router. See the manual provided with the
wireless router for details.
