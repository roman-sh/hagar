# Executive Summary: Hagar™ Inventory Automation

Hagar™ is an AI-driven inventory automation system built to eliminate one of the most time-consuming operational burdens in retail: translating manual delivery notes into accurate inventory updates. Store managers simply scan a paper invoice or forward a PDF via WhatsApp. From that moment, an intelligent processing pipeline digitizes the document, extracts line items, matches them to the store’s product catalog, and prepares a clean, ready-to-apply inventory update.

At the core of Hagar™ is a human-in-the-loop architecture designed for both precision and user confidence. Instead of modifying sensitive data autonomously, the AI acts as a collaborative assistant. A combination of OCR and advanced vision models handles structured document extraction and cleanup, while cost-efficient text models manage semantic matching, validation, and the conversational flow. The system progressively learns from user corrections, allowing recurring supplier formats to be processed with increasing automation over time.

To accommodate different operational and security preferences, Hagar™ includes a flexible integration layer. It can operate in a fully automated mode—authenticating through secure headless browser sessions to update the back-office directly—or in a “credential-less” mode using a custom Chrome extension. This approach enables catalog synchronization and inventory preparation without being granted direct back-office access. For maximum control, the system can also generate import-ready Excel files, letting managers apply updates manually through their back-office interface.
